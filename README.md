A Windows+Linux sticky notes app. It probably works on Mac, too, but I don't have one to test that theory.

This app is made up of various note windows (each note saved in the app's SQLite database can have its own window) which can be moved around and pinned (to stay on top of other windows) and a master notes list, which can be used to search for old notes and open/delete/etc them. This is a somewhat more feature-rich Sticky Notes clone.
